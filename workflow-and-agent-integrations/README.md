**Title:** DevOps Process: Workflow vs. Agent-based Design

**Use Case:** Kubernetes Operator Upgrade Process

---

## Workflow Design: Fixed Kubernetes Operator Upgrade Pipeline

**Steps:**
1. **Trigger:** Monitor for new release (e.g., GitHub webhook or cron job)
2. **Validation:** Fetch changelog manually or via script
3. **Preflight Check:** Backup existing CRDs and CRs
4. **Upgrade Execution:** Update Helm/Kustomize charts → Apply to staging
5. **Verification:** Run smoke tests, ensure reconciliation works
6. **Rollout:** Promote to production (manual/approval gate)

**Characteristics:**
* Fixed path regardless of complexity
* Safe, testable, and easy to debug
* Hard-coded error handling

## Agent Design: Dynamic Upgrade Agent for Operators
**Goal:** Keep the operator up-to-date safely

**Process:**
1. **Goal:** Detect new operator release
2. **Observation:** Compare current vs. upstream version
3. **Reasoning:** Use LLM to analyze changelogs, perform CRD diffs, simulate upgrade impact
4. **Planning:** Decide whether to:
   * Suggest patch to Helm manifests
   * Modify CRs to match new schema
   * Pause upgrade if risky
5. **Tool Use:**
   * `GitHub API` → Get releases
   * `Kube API` → Export CRs
   * `Diff Tool` → Compare CRDs
   * `Validation Tool` → Run schema test
   * `PR Tool` → Create upgrade PR
6. **Act:** Execute planned actions, retry if failure
7. **Replan:** If test fails, re-analyze logs and propose fallback plan
8. **Dependency Check:** If there are any dependent operator that needs to be upgraded prior, execute the upgrade on them

**Characteristics:**
* Uses tool calls adaptively
* Can pause, retry, or take alternate path
* Maintains intermediate state and reasoning history

## Comparison

| Feature          | Workflow (Fixed Policy)    | Agent (Goal-Oriented System)     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Trigger Logic    | Cron/GitHub event          | Observed goal or user input      |
| Tool Use         | Static (Helm, kubectl, CI) | Dynamic (selects based on state) |
| Adaptability     | Low                        | High                             |
| Failure Recovery | Manual or scripted         | Built-in re-plan logic           |
| Ideal For        | Routine upgrades           | Risky/complex upgrades           |
| Auditability     | High (loggable CI steps)   | Medium (state must be logged)    |

## Summary
* Use **Workflows** for upgrades where:
  * The upgrade process is well-understood
  * Changes are low risk or frequent (e.g., weekly cert-manager bump)
  * Reproducibility is key
* Use **Agents** for upgrades where:
  * The operator introduces CRD schema changes
  * User-defined CRs may break
  * Context-aware decisions are needed (e.g., only upgrade if no breaking changes)
  * Proactive reasoning and rollback strategy is critical
